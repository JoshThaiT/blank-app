## Overview
This project uses computer vision, specifically Yolopose, to detect human poses and will identify 3 types of exercises using machine learning.
Pull Ups, Push Ups and Sit Ups.
The repition of each exercise will be counted using a state machine based of exercise biomechanics.

This project was built to explore real-time ML inference and exercise tracking.
